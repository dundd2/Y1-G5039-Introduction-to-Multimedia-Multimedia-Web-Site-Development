# Y1-G5039 Introduction to Multimedia-Multimedia Web Site Development
Multimedia Web Site Development
Deadline - 4pm Friday 24th November
Create a set of CSS managed web pages to the following specification and adhering to HCI and design guidelines.

You should design the site as if it was your own personal site, but do not include any personal details (such as your name).

Your development should contain the following 5 pages:

1. Home page This is the root page for your site and so should contain introductory material to include the following:

a. A name for your site (of your own choosing)

b. A short text introduction to your site

c. An image (of your own choosing which you have taken or is from a source that allows free use).

2. A Video page. This should contain an embedded video clip to demonstrate embedding of video in a HTML page.  The clip can be of any suitable content that complies with the University regulations (i.e. is not indecent, violent or discriminatory).
3. A Hobbies/Activities Page. A description of one or more of your hobbies/activities (real or invented).

4. A Coursework portfolio page. A page containing structured links to the documents that you have prepared for this module so far, this should include your work from labs 2 (part 3) and 3, plus any other coursework you wish to include.

5. A Clock animation using JavaScript. This should include the work from Lab 4, but you can extend this for extra marks - see marking scheme below.

 

Marking Scheme used in the peer assessment.

Personal Web Page Parts 1-4 worth 50%

A mark of 30% will be awarded for a set of web pages that just meet the basic specification set out in parts 1 - 4 above in a well-designed manner and contains your lab work from labs 2 and 3. You will need to state the browser you have developed for.

Higher marks (possible extra 20%) will be given for multimedia enhancements, such as (this list is only an example):

Good use of additional components, rollover buttons, javascript etc.
Appropriate use of any other additional multimedia components such as sound, video and animation.
Switchable CSS styles which can be swapped by the viewer of the site
A more complex site containing extra material and/or functionality that you have created yourself, such as navigable photo/video/audio album, simple games etc. 
A site which is identical when viewed in all main browsers (IE, Firefox, Chrome).
JavaScript Clock Animation (Part 5) worth 50%

A mark of 20% will be awarded for a development that just meets the basic specification set out in Lab 4.

Higher marks (possible extra 30%) will be given for enhancements to your vector animation, such as:

Added functionality e.g. date, stopwatch, alarm etc.
Improved design or addition of digital readout
Highly realistic physical behaviour e.g. springy seconds hand 
Interactivity
Submission

This will be via your web space on the Sussex server. You should set up your personal space  and read the ITS documentation detailing how to upload to your personal web folder. You should upload your site to a folder called IM in your root web folder (public_html). To prevent your site being freely accessible add an index.html document with no content to your IM folder. You will then have to give your home page a name of your choosing (not index.html). Only people who know this page name will be able to access your site. You will need to submit your home page URL before the deadline by using the "Start assignment" link above.

You will be expected to submit your URL and upload your website including clock animation and make sure that they are working properly by the deadline shown at the top of this page.

Please upload material as you progress with this project and do not rely on being able to upload material 10 minutes before the deadline. You have plenty of time to complete this assignment and should aim to have uploaded and tested your completed website the week before the deadline!

Note: Please take extra care to save and back-up your work regularly, loss of work due to computer failure will not be considered as exceptional circumstances for a late submission.
